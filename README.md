# Etcher
*Recycle and rewrite music discs.*

Etcher is a micro-mod to solve one pet peeve of mine - going spelunking and finding all sorts of structures, only to get 30 "cat" discs and 40 "13" discs.

Etcher lets you smelt duplicate music discs into "blanks" that you can rewrite in the newly added Etcher block.
